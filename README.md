# physics_engine

## Simple physics engine based on kinematic equations.

This project presents a physics engine or simulator based on kinematic equations. SDL is used to create the application window, openGL to create 3D image and kinematics alters the position and orientation of objects in the visualizer.

Third Party:
The directory third_party includes files from external sources. A description of each source and its origin follows,

* glad is generated using https://gen.glad.sh/, interface to openGL
* stb originates from 'git clone https://github.com/nothings/stb.git'
* imgui (not in this repository, Cmake fetches on build)
